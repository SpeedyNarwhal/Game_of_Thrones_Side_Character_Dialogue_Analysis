2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,We are the lords of small matters here.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Mmm, how much?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,A dear friend told me.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Is she?
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
2011-05-01,Season 1,Episode 3,Lord Snow,petyr baelish,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,I will?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,I hear you're reading a boring book.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,I promised Cat that I'd help you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Lover's quarrel?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",petyr baelish,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,No honor but quite a bit of gold.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,You do move quietly.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Saw me with your own eyes?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,One shudders at the thought.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,To a small council meeting?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,When do you return to Winterfell?
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
2011-05-15,Season 1,Episode 5,The Wolf and the Lion,petyr baelish,My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
2011-05-22,Season 1,Episode 6,A Golden Crown,petyr baelish,"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,I'm saving myself for another.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,A stupid saying.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,For many years. Most of my life really.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,My Lord protector.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So when the King dies...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So it would seem. Unless...
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,And he cannot take the throne without your help.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Only if we lose.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,So it will be Stannis and war?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,"So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,Now!
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,petyr baelish,I did warn you not to trust me.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,petyr baelish,"The girl is innocent, Your Grace."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,petyr baelish,"A naked Knight, apparently."
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,petyr baelish,Do you deny your father's crime?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?"
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,"A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,Playing our roles.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,petyr baelish,Long may he reign. My king.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Curious.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?"
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Yes.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,petyr baelish,Knowledge is power.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,That's why they're called wildlings.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,Who?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,petyr baelish,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Tell no one what?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Harrenhal is cursed.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,The Queen mustn't know.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,"And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Leave me out of your next deception.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,petyr baelish,Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I'm a practical man.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I would give priority to my head.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,You may have heard false reports.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"No, my lady."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
2012-04-22,Season 2,Episode 4,Garden of Bones,petyr baelish,Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"My lord, my lady."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,Stannis.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,"He was, Your Grace."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,petyr baelish,Do you want to be a queen?
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,Lord Tywin.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,Thank you.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"Yes, she does."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,They have.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,It's only wine.
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"Tonight, with your leave."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
2012-05-06,Season 2,Episode 6,The Old Gods and the New,petyr baelish,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,"You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,My lady. My sincerest condolences.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,"You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,"He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,petyr baelish,Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,How do I know?
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,petyr baelish,"I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,Titles do seem to breed titles.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Thank you, my dear."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,You should have him knighted.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I know.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,Keep a low profile.
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"Well, you are richer than I am."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,petyr baelish,"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I shall do my best.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I assure you that it will.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,That didn't take long.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Lady Margaery wears it that way.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,Petyr.
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
2013-04-28,Season 3,Episode 5,Kissed by Fire,petyr baelish,We'll speak again when I return.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,petyr baelish,"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,petyr baelish,"Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,And who helped me with this conspiracy?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Why not?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,Then perhaps it was your husband.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,How do you know?
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,petyr baelish,"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,My lord.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Oh. I have brought you a gift.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,My lady.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Go. We'll speak soon.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,I do think that we could wait until...
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,Like it was yesterday.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Tonight it is, then."
2014-05-04,Season 4,Episode 5,First of His Name,petyr baelish,"Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Children.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"Yes, I saw."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,You're more beautiful than she ever was.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Call me Petyr.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Lysa! Let her go.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,Let her go.
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,petyr baelish,"I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,He has other gifts.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,I did.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,We are.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,petyr baelish,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,You are becoming an observant young lady.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Do you like the taste?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,It gives some men courage.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,But you were accused.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,Then what did happen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,petyr baelish,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Home.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,No.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,He did.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,For now.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Winterfell is your home.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Sansa -
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,He seems pleased.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,petyr baelish,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Come. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,I am.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,King's Landing.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,petyr baelish,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Yes? Lancel Lannister.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,That's quite a family to abandon.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Well done.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"I would counsel patience, your grace."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Ser Jaime, then."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,Name me Warden of the North.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
2015-05-17,Season 5,Episode 6,"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken",petyr baelish,As I said. I live to serve.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,I'm sorry about the locale.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,It felt like the safest place.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,I promise you..
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,petyr baelish,The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,The Defender of the Vale!
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,My lord Come and see
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,I missed your name day Go on
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,A gyrfalcon The greatest and rarest of birds
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,Indeed I was
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,"On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,"Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,Your home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,"Lord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,I think he deserves one more chance What do you say?
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,"I bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her"
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,That was my instinct as well
2016-05-15,Season 6,Episode 4,Book of the Stranger,petyr baelish,Our lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,"Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I can't begin to contemplate --
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,He beat you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,"Sansa, I --"
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,Did he cut you?
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I didn't know.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,"I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I'm so sorry.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,Then I will die.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,I would do anything to undo what's been done to you. I know that I can't. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,Your brother's army.
2016-05-22,Season 6,Episode 5,The Door,petyr baelish,Half-brother.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,petyr baelish,"Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,I only meant to say --
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,"One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,petyr baelish,"Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,This is for you.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,stands up to leave.
2017-08-06,Season 7,Episode 4,The Spoils Of War,petyr baelish,bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,petyr baelish,Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,She's your sister
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,petyr baelish,Why did she come to Winterfell?
