2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Did he hurt you?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I wanted to. I just couldn't.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I'm a coward. My father always says so.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"No, that's all right. I'm fine."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I don't like high places.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"I'm not going to get any better, you know?"
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I find that hard to believe.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,You didn't know where to put it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Was she... Old and ugly?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,What color hair?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,I like red hair. And her... Her...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,That good?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Jon Snow?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,Because... You're a bastard from the north.
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,So... You didn't know where to put it?
2011-05-08,Season 1,Episode 4,"Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things",sam tarly,It is a bit nippy.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I miss girls.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for..."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"my lord, might I go as well?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"No, my lord."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,The Night's Watch is my house now.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?"
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister?
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,"Could you sing me a song, Pyp? I'd like to hear a song."
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.
2011-05-29,Season 1,Episode 7,You Win or You Die,sam tarly,I always wanted to be a Wizard.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,sam tarly,The smell.
2011-06-05,Season 1,Episode 8,The Pointy End,sam tarly,There is none.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,l - l can't.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,l'm really not supposed to say.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
2011-06-12,Season 1,Episode 9,Baelor,sam tarly,"He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,You can't!
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,What are you going to do?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,You can't leave us now. We need you here.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,l won't let you go.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,No.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,Did we get him?
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,But we're your brothers now.
2011-06-19,Season 1,Episode 10,Fire and Blood,sam tarly,Hear my words and bear witness to my vow
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam tarly,Nothing's killed me yet.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam tarly,You offered me a ride!
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam tarly,Are those girls?
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam tarly,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam tarly,That's foul.
2012-04-01,Season 2,Episode 1,The North Remembers,sam tarly,Hmm?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,I'm sure that's nice too.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,You were with her? How many times?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"No. Ghost, no. No. Ghost, away. Shoo. Shoo! . You all right? Did he frighten you?"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. ."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,I know it sounds a bit mad.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -"
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,Why did you do that?
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,You were cruel.
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,I didn't touch her!
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
2012-04-08,Season 2,Episode 2,The Night Lands,sam tarly,I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam tarly,Lord Commander-
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam tarly,Gilly.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam tarly,"I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother."
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam tarly,Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam tarly,I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
2012-04-15,Season 2,Episode 3,What Is Dead May Never Die,sam tarly,Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam tarly,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam tarly,"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam tarly,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam tarly,"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam tarly,Well I read it in a book.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam tarly,I don't see very well.
2012-04-29,Season 2,Episode 5,The Ghost of Harrenhal,sam tarly,"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,Where do you think Jon is right now?
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,That's a Night's Watch cloak.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,Oh. Must be dragonglass.
2012-05-20,Season 2,Episode 8,The Prince of Winterfell,sam tarly,The maesters call it obsidian.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sam tarly,"If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is"
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sam tarly,"No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better."
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sam tarly,And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sam tarly,It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sam tarly,Wait! Wait for me!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sam tarly,Grenn!
2012-06-03,Season 2,Episode 10,Valar Morghulis,sam tarly,Edd!
2013-03-31,Season 3,Episode 1,Valar Dohaeris,sam tarly,Brother?
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam tarly,No.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam tarly,I can't.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam tarly,You don't care.
2013-04-07,Season 3,Episode 2,"Dark Wings, Dark Words",sam tarly,"You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me."
2013-04-14,Season 3,Episode 3,Walk of Punishment,sam tarly,Ghost?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam tarly,I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam tarly,He's beautiful. Does he have a name?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam tarly,Are you going to give him one?
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam tarly,Gilly.
2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,sam tarly,I wanted you to have it.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,"But the more wood, the bigger the fire."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,Huh. You know your fires.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,"It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,"Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,Not so far. A few more days.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,"I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,"No. No, no, no. Not very well."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,"Oh, all right. Let's see."
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,sam tarly,"Oh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,How hard can it be to build a fire?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,He winked at me before.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,I saw him wink at me.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,"Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,What? No. This is just the way I talk.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,Don't you think he should have a name?
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,"Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,"Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,"No, Randyll Tarly."
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,Please don't name him Randyll.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,Different manner of cruel.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,I'll be back. I just want to look.
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,Stay back!
2013-05-19,Season 3,Episode 8,Second Sons,sam tarly,You stay back!
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,"We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us. It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I. Too big, impossible to maintain. Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us. It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself. No one's used it for centuries, most likely. It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,I read about it in a very old book.
2013-06-02,Season 3,Episode 9,The Rains of Castamere,sam tarly,Yes.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,Don't kill me!
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,Who's your brother?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,"I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,What? Why in the world would you want to go-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,"If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,"What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,How do you know all that?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,But you're going to stop them?
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,Killing White Walkers.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,"Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,"And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,I know how this must look. What I meant was-
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,Maester.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,She hasn't chosen a name yet.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,"He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,Miles better.
2013-06-09,Season 3,Episode 10,Mhysa,sam tarly,"Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us."

2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam tarly,Sometimes I want to hate you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam tarly,"Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading."
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam tarly,They're... they're ready for you.
2014-04-06,Season 4,Episode 1,Two Swords,sam tarly,No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,She's not a whore.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,They all think I'm lying.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,Killing the white Walker.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,"Well, a wildling."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,"It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,"100 men, one woman."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,That's the only thing they think about.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,For what?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,"I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,"He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,No other work.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,"This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,You have to trust me. It's for the best.
2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,sam tarly,"Oh, Gilly. Please don't."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam tarly,I should neverhave taken her away.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam tarly,"She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam tarly,I should go back for Gilly.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam tarly,I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam tarly,"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did."
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam tarly,I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
2014-04-27,Season 4,Episode 4,Oathkeeper,sam tarly,Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
2014-05-18,Season 4,Episode 7,Mockingbird,sam tarly,"All right, Jon?"
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam tarly,I should never have left her there.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam tarly,Of course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam tarly,She's dead because of me.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam tarly,Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam tarly,She might have.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,What was she like?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Oh? How big were her feet?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"No, you're really not."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Let me help you.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Maester Faull
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,I don't love her.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,No.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,You were?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Who was she?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Pyp! Open the gate.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Yes!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Never.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,I'm not leaving you!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Help my brothers.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,I promise you I won't die.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Did you get one?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Yeah?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,If you keep missing we will.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Oh, is it over?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,to Grenn* We need more men down here.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,But we need men here.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,We need you boy.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?"
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,We held them off.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,This is a great victory.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Where are you going?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,What are you doing?
2014-06-08,Season 4,Episode 9,The Watchers on the Wall,sam tarly,Jon. Come back.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam tarly,"Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam tarly,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam tarly,All the wildlings.
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam tarly,"It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--"
2015-04-12,Season 5,Episode 1,The Wars to Come,sam tarly,"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,Did you ever see them?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,Your Grace.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,Maester Aemon.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,"A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,"Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
2015-04-19,Season 5,Episode 2,The House of Black and White,sam tarly,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sam tarly,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
2015-04-26,Season 5,Episode 3,High Sparrow,sam tarly,"Alright, alright! Enough of that."

2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam tarly,They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam tarly,More than Lord Wibberley.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam tarly,"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam tarly,We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
2015-05-03,Season 5,Episode 4,Sons of the Harpy,sam tarly,"Apologies, my Lady."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,There is good farmland in the Gift. . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,Every book there is?
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,Well -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,It's where they train the maesters.
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"Ah, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"I am, Your Grace."

2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,What the maesters call obsidian -
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,"I've seen it, Your Grace."
2015-05-10,Season 5,Episode 5,Kill the Boy,sam tarly,The army of the dead. And when they come -

2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,"Oh, and…"
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,It's Dragonglass. It's what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don't need them.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,"His little brother, Aegon. He became king."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,You don't know that.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,I'll stay too. He's always been good to me. I can't leave him now.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,"His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King's Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,"Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,I'm warning you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,I said get your hands off her.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I'll take my chances with you.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,I'm alright.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,I will not. They wouldo ve… I don't know what they would have done
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,"Of course I will. And I'll take care of you, too."
2015-05-24,Season 5,Episode 7,The Gift,sam tarly,Stay. Please.

2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,No.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,How are you?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,You know what I mean.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Are you scared?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Me too.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Who's there?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Come in.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,You're a good lad.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Now then. How can I help?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Yes?
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,We've been fighting them for years.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Olly...
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,"I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,With all my heart.
2015-05-31,Season 5,Episode 8,Hardhome,sam tarly,Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,sam tarly,It wasn't.
2015-06-07,Season 5,Episode 9,The Dance of Dragons,sam tarly,"You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,So what are you gonna do?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,But… the Dragonglass?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,But… you killed a White Walker.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,"Well, there's Edd."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,"I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,"If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,Thank you.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,They'll bloody try.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,What?
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,Very carefully.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,I'll come back.
2015-06-14,Season 5,Episode 10,Mother’s Mercy,sam tarly,To my return.
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,"Yes Yes, I'm fine"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,I don't think so
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,"Yeah, they do"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,"No No, no, no The Citadel doesn't admit women There won't be a place for you there or for Little Sam"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,The Citadel isn't Castle Black I don't have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,By yourself? With a baby and no money?
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,"To my home Horn Hill My father's -- well, my father, but my mother's a kind woman and my sister's lovely They'll take care of you both"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,I said that because I want you and Little Same to be safe That's all I want -- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,"I don't care about them Well, no, I do, but I don't really I care about you and him"
2016-05-08,Season 6,Episode 3,Oathbreaker,sam tarly,I'd feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,I told them I met you in the North.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, hello, Mother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,Oh.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Talla? Gods, you're a woman now."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,Where is Father? And Dickon?
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,It's beautiful. You're beautiful.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?"
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, that's a fair distance."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,Gilly.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,I'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,First light.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,Say good-bye to him for me.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Good-bye, Gilly."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,We're leaving.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,Get your things.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,We belong together. All of us.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,"Oh, they'll understand."
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,She won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,It's my family's sword.
2016-05-29,Season 6,Episode 6,Blood of My Blood,sam tarly,He can bloody well try.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam tarly,Hello.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam tarly,From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam tarly,I'm-- I'm to be the new maester.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam tarly,He died.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam tarly,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He's since passed away. Which is why I'm here.
2016-06-26,Season 6,Episode 10,The Winds of Winter,sam tarly,"Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,"Archmaester, I was wondering..."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,"Um, 147."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,No.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,Sources in the restricted area?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,"So, you believe me."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,The dead don't.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,"A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,Who?
2017-07-16,Season 7,Episode 1,Dragonstone,sam tarly,Haven't heard anything.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Pardon, Archmaester. I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black. She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured. Isn't there some way --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,No.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Mormont?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Archmaester, I wanted to --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,I wanted to ask you --
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Possibly something a bit more poetic?
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah. There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured. I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Oh, you are?"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Oh.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Hello.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,You're Jorah Mormont. You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"My name is Samwell Tarley. I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black. I knew your father. I was with him when he died. You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,Drink this.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Rum. Drink it all, please. I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,If you could take off your shirt.
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard. I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here. If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"No. No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got. Have a seat. I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
2017-07-23,Season 7,Episode 2,Stormborn,sam tarly,"Shh, shhh. Again, I'm sorry. Please try not to scream."
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I suppose I'll find out this evening.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Where will you go?
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Your father saved me more than once. It's the least I could do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I hope they do.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,Yes.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,No one.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I seem to remember you.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I did.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,I read the books and followed the instructions.
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,sam tarly,"Thank you, Archmaester."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,stops working and turns around.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,Brandon Stark --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,the crippled boy.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,I let him through the Wall years ago. I saw him go beyond the wall.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could. Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one. Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,steps forward and clears his throat.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you. If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it. If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it. And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"Archmaester, please. It's real. I've seen it."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,Archmaester --
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,No.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,looks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,looks away and pauses.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,None anymore.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,isn't paying much attention to GILLY. He loudly interrupts her.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored. But that's all right, isn't it. We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynardo s 15,782 shits."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,is dismayed. He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr. He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,"is walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door."
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,is loading a wagon with his things. He walks around to the driver seat. GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road. SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.
2017-08-13,Season 7,Episode 5,Eastwatch,sam tarly,I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,"Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,Oh! I don't know what that means.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,"Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,Oh.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,The truth about what?
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,It's not.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Oh!
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,And also a sword.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"It wouldo ve been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,You know him?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,What are you doing out here?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?"
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Of course not.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She's good.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Don't you know?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She didn't tell you.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Would you have done it?
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,But you were. You've always been.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,"No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it."
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,She shouldn't be.
2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Why? What does he want?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Have you told her yet?
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,They'll be safe down in the crypt.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-"
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,It's called Heartsbane. It's my family sword.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,"Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it."
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,I'll see you when it's through.
2019-04-21,Season 8,Episode 2,A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms,sam tarly,I hope we win.
2019-04-28,Season 8,Episode 3,The Long Night,sam tarly,Edd! Edd!
2019-05-05,Season 8,Episode 4,The Last of the Starks,sam tarly,"Uh, hold on."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,Why just us?
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,"Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,Aye.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,He-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,"I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,Your Grace.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,"He was last spotted flying east, toward-"
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,Long may he reign.
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
2019-05-19,Season 8,Episode 6,The Iron Throne,sam tarly,Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
