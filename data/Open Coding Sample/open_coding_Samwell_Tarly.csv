2019-04-14,Season 8,Episode 1,Winterfell,sam tarly,It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
2014-06-01,Season 4,Episode 8,The Mountain and the Viper,sam tarly,She might have.
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,sam tarly,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
